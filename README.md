## 🛠️ Tools Used

### 1. **Pylint** - Code Quality Guardian
- Identifies code smells, logical errors, and maintainability issues
- Provides comprehensive code quality scoring (0-10)
- Flags poor practices and potential bugs

### 2. **Bandit** - Security Watchdog
- Detects security vulnerabilities and dangerous patterns
- Identifies common security anti-patterns in Python code
- Focuses on preventing code injection and other attacks

### 3. **Flake8** - Style Enforcer
- Enforces PEP 8 Python style guide compliance
- Checks formatting, naming conventions, and code structure
- Ensures consistent, readable code across the project

---

## 🔧 Major Issues Fixed

### 🔒 Security Issues
- **Removed dangerous `eval()` function** - Eliminated code injection risk
- **Replaced bare `except:` clauses** - No more silent security failures
- **Implemented safe file operations** - Context managers for resource safety

### 🐛 Critical Bugs
- **Fixed mutable default arguments** - `logs=[]` → `logs=None` pattern
- **Added comprehensive input validation** - Type and value checking
- **Improved error handling** - Specific exceptions with proper logging

### ✨ Code Quality
- **Enhanced documentation** - Complete docstrings for all functions
- **Modern Python features** - Type hints, f-strings, context managers
- **Better naming conventions** - Snake_case throughout codebase
